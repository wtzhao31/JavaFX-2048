# JavaFX-2048
I created a 2048 game that is controlled with WASD using JavaFX. 
This game was created for a final project for a Graphical User Interfaces class I took in spring 2021. Its interface is based off the real game of 2048. The program contains sound files, animations to show tile movement, and it can also save the user's highest score. JavaFX additional downloads are required to run this program.
